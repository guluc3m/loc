User
====

User accounts in the platform (including administrator ones). Note that session
management is performed by means of a JWT token obtained through the
:doc:`/api/users/login` endpoint.

User roles are registered in the `user_roles` database relationship, and are
checked on certain operations.

Users can follow other users. Followers can see matches in which other users
have participated. This is is done through the `followers` database
relationship.
