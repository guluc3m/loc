# /v1/parties

The `parties` endpoint implements functionalities related to match parties.


## Join a party

<aside class="notice">
Authenticated endpoint.
</aside>

Join a party by using the invite token provided by the party leader, or found
through LFG if the party is public.

By joining a party, the `Party` record created for the user (technically
in their own party) is deleted, and the `party_owner_id` of the
`MatchParticipant` record is set to the ID of the leader of the new party.

### HTTP Request

`POST /v1/parties/join`

> Example request:

```json
{
    "token": "JWT_TOKEN",
    "party": "123456789abcdefgh"
}
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| token | string | JSON Web Token (obtained from `/v1/account/login`) |
| party | string | Unique party token |


### HTTP Response

```json
{
    "status": "success",
    "data": {
        "members": ["usera", "userb", "userc"]
    }
}
```

> Example response [400]:

```json
{
    "status": "fail",
    "data": {
        "party": "The party cannot accept any more members"
    }
}

    }
}
```

{
    "status": "fail",

`max_members` attribute of the match.


## Leave a party

<aside class="notice">
Authenticated endpoint.
</aside>

Leave a party. This can only be performed by non-leader members of the party
and before the match starts.

When the user leaves a party, a new `Party` record is created to indicate
that they are in their own party, and the `party_owner_id` in their
`MatchParticipant` record is set to their own ID.
