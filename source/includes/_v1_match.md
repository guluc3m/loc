By joining a match, a [`MatchParticipant`](#matchparticipant) record is created
for the user in the specified match. By default, the user will be in their own
party, therefore the `party_owner_id` will be the user ID.

In addition, a [`PartyToken`](#partytoken) is also created. This token can be
used to invite other users to your own party. It is deleted once the user joins
a party owned by another user.
